	             <div id="paragraph"><p>My partner and I are both education majors. We are currently at 11th hour working on this assignment. They have good matcha and mediocre chai. There is no jelly for the bicuits. A lady in line behind us confronted a man about his small dog being off leash. Okay that's all for now. Bye divas!</p>

				   <p>Restate the challenge of the lab here.</p>
			 </div>

			 <div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> The first problem we had was in CSS. We had a hard time using fonts until we got help from our TA. We also took some time figuring out how to get our border to surround the correct area. Finally, in HTML we had some issues defining our headers.  </p>

			 <div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment showed us how much of this class would be trial and error. There were parts that were frustrating since we kept getting things wrong. In Wes' words, the more we mess up in this class, the better we are becoming at coding. </p>
