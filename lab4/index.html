			<h1>Lab 4 - Psuedocoding and Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In lab we were challenged to describe an everyday task as psudocode. We also began the psuedocode for a computer game. This lab began preparing us better to begin working with Java Script.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>WIt was unusual to write about a mundane task in so much detail. It was hard to consider the lanuguge we used and what would communicate best with a computer. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>We think this lab went pretty well. We pushed each other to be very detail-oriented in our writing. We feel prepared to begin adding Java Script to our project. </p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Daily task: changing a babyâ€™s Diaper
						Prep/Supplies:
						Diaper
						Wipes
						Take the crying baby and place them laying flat on their back on a comfortable surface 
						Remove baby's clothing from the waist down 
						Undo baby's diaper by tugging gently on either side of Velcro straps that are secured on baby's pelvis 
						Now that the diaper is undone, take a baby wipe and make sure to gently, but thoroughly clean the baby's bum. 
						Remove the dirty diaper and place dirty wipe(s) inside. Leave the dirty diaper to the side. 
						Grab a new and fresh diaper, open it by tugging on the Velcro straps on either side. 
						Now to put the new diaper on the baby you will with one hand take both of the baby's feet and lift them so that the baby's hips are elevated. 
						With baby's hips elevated you will take your other hand that has the fresh diaper open and slide it under baby's bum 
						Gently place babys feet back down and secure the diaper using the Velcro straps. 
						Dress baby in their clothes from the waist down. 

						Creating a connect 4 game
						Print a board of blank dots 6 height, 7 width
						Accept user input along top row
						Do not allow moves into occupied spaces and columns
						Validate user move
						Move user chip to lowest unoccupied space in column
						Choose computer move
						Test win or draw condition

						</p>
